        Leankoala tests a website by using simple checks like the Lean Testing approach suggests.
        This application also takes care of the whole incident lifecycle, starting with cyclic checks,
        alerting and data analysis.

                Leankoala provides 14 tools that are able to check if a website is working correctly.
                A few examples of those checks include a ping tool, an xpath checker, a regEx tool and some security checks.

                Many websites can be tested the same way, which is why we introduced "recipes". A "recipe" is a set of
                rules that can be applied to any component.

                Everything that happens in Leankoala stays in Leankoala. We store all incidents in our database for at least one year.
                Additionally, we have all event data available for two months.

                When finding an anomaly in the checked system, Leankoala will immediately send a notifitcation to a defined group of recipients.
                This can be done via E-Mail, Webhook or Slack.

                Incidents occur even in the best environments. To reduce the amount of work needed, project collaborators can 
                be assigned to an incident.

                We love Slack. That is why Leankoala is not only able to send notifications via slack, but is also able to list, acknowledge
                and close incidents directly via Slack.
