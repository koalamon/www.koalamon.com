        Leankoala helps to test a website using simple checks like the leantesting approach suggests.
        Additionally this application takes care of the whole incident lifecycle. Starting with cyclic checks,
        alerting and data analysis.

                Leankoala provides 14 tools that are able to check if a website is working correct.

                Many websites can be tested the same way. That is why we introduced recipes. A recipe is a set of
                rules that can be applied to any component.
