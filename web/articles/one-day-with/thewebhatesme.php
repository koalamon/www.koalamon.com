                Phphatesme started in 2008 as a hobby project, but grew to be the most famous German
                php blog the next year. With about 2.000 readers a day in 2010 it became an important source of
                information for the german php community.
            </p>
            <p>
                After four years of blogging the focus on php was lost as more web technologies rose. JavaScript, Html, CSS and other
                topics were part of the daily work. Additionally project management, leadership and quality management
                got on focus.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2013 the blog was renamed to "the web hates me" and is still one of the most important contact point
                for many web devlopers.

                The web hates me is based on wordpress. That means, that the main feature like creating a blog post or a page should work
                by default. The templates for the homepage, the posts and the pages where created from the scratch as well as some wordpress
                plugins.
