                <h2>The Story of amilio</h2>
            </a>
            <p>
                amilio was founded in 2015 by some friends with a technical background. The idea they had was, that everybody is an
                expert in something. So everybody can recommend products in his or hers domain. amilio builds on top of that idea.
                When registering you are able to curate product lists of stuff you like. Additionally you can add your affiliate id
                so you can earn some money with your lists.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the idea behind amilio seems to be very promising, the team decided to build a proof of concept first. A good
                looking proof but still a proof. Paying to much attention to technical details could be a waste of time if you don't
                know if a project idea will work.

                The amilio platform is deployed continuously via jenkins ci. Therefore it is important to check if the most important
                features are still working afterwards. Here, the central focus lies on the product lists and collection.

                amilio is based on the symfony2 framework and is written in php. It was a conscious decision to choose those two
                technology because of their robustness and the many existing components. With millions of users of the same stack
                the need for tests of these component is nominal.

                With amilio we created a very complex and flexible system for a big community. With leankoala we got rid off the
                most of our selenium tests that were only checking for the existence of text fragments. Those test were expensive
                to create and broke from time to time. With leankoala our test effort is minimal.
            </p>
            <p>
                What we can't test with leankoala is the login process. Therefore we have small selenium tests running in combination
                with BrowserStack.
