                    On the one hand customers want quality but on the other customers don't want to pay for it. With Leankoala we
                    provide a strategy and the suitable test suite that focuses on efficient and affordable quality assurance.

                <p>
                    The idea behind lean testing and Leankoala originated from eight years testing websites from two of the biggest publishing
                    companies in europe. We know how to handle editorial content that meets technology.

                <h3>Easy for website operators</h3>
                <p>
                    When developing Leankoala one thing we always had in mind was that it must be easy to solve standard problems and possible to
                    solve the hard ones. For all website operators we kept the entry threshold low.

                    Hitting your website with heavy tools can be very expensive. Having a risk based lean approach reduces cost and helps
                    testing your websites much faster with less effort.

        <p>
            The agency business can be very tough. Customers want their web projects to be developed in no time, with low costs and high
            quality. That to achieve is almost impossible. In many cases one of the three goals has to be dropped and mostly it's quality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our observations revealed dropping quality does not equal that it is the least important goal. In our opinion it is often a wrong
            understanding of what quality means. Most projects are from an objective point of view <span style="">only</span> standard. You connect standard features
            and components to create a new system. Additionally there are only a few use cases in that system that have real business values.
        </p>
        <p>
            For testing those <strong>standard features</strong> Leankoala provides <strong>standard checks</strong>. Often that is all that
            is needed. In addition we offer a new and different testing concept we already verified on many conferences, press article and the
            german book
            "<a href="https://www.amazon.de/Erfolgreiche-Softwareprojekte-Web-Gedanken-Webentwicklung/dp/3868020888" target="_blank">Erfolgreiche
                Softwareprojekt im Web</a>". One of our goals is to push the lean testing movement so you don't have to sell it to your client.

            When creating Leankoala we always had one target group in mind. Publishing companies. This is not only because at that time
            we were working for two of the largest publishing companies in europe but also because the lean testing approach perfectly
            matches with editorial websites.
        </p>

        <p>
            Having a look at websites like www.stern.de and www.cosmopolitan.de with the hundreds of thousand articles they provide
            it seems quite complex to test it. Having closer look at those pages the complexity is not that high. In most cases there only
            are ony a few components like a standard article, a tag page, the search results or a category page. That is almost everything to
            test. Additionally there a pages like the sitemap or smaller APIs that are used. There mostly is no user interaction with the
            page.
        </p>

        <p>
            We found out that when trying to test such a website there are some key tests to write. For example a standard article can be tested
            within four checks: is the headline existing, is the page footer existing, does the google analytics pixel gets counted and do javascript
            errors occur. When none of those checks fail the chance the website is working is 95 percent. <strong>With Leankoala those checks are
                created within minutes.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            There are a lot of business that depend on their websites. If the sites do not work the revenue will disappear as well. The problem with
            such businesses is that they often can't afford a quality assurance team.
        </p>

        <p>
            With Leankoala we provide a software as a servie solution that helps writing easy system tests by just a few clicks. Using our wizards
            everybody is able to build up a good foundation for any website. We can archive that because we focus on modern websites and know
            what the most common features are. For those features we provide predefined tests on top of our tools. If it is necessary to go deeper
            all tools can also be manually configured.
